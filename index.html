  <h1>All About Strawberries</h1>

<p>
Strawberries are one of my favourite fruits in the world. They are sweet, refreshing, and beautifully vibrant in colour. Whether they are eaten fresh, blended into smoothies, or used to decorate desserts, strawberries always add a perfect balance of flavour and brightness. I enjoy learning about the different varieties of strawberries, how they grow, and how farmers cultivate them. They are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and are surprisingly versatile in everyday cooking.</p>
